  description: |-
    A voice whispers to you: It would be wise to practice protecting yourself. There are a number of training dummies in this area that, while not pushovers, will not be too difficult.
    - Use '<white>kill worm</white>' to start combat against the scaly worm
    - Once it's dead any loot it drops will be in its corpse on the ground. You can use '<white>look in corpse</white>' to check again or '<white>loot corpse</white>' to retrieve all your loot.
  completionMessage: |-
    <b><cyan>Hint: You can get the loot from enemies with '<white>get <item> corpse</white>' but be quick about it, the corpse will decay after some time.</cyan>
